# How to Preview Ghost's Drafts in GatsbyJS

You can read the full tutorial on my website. It's comprised of three parts:
1. [Bootstrap the project](https://fedetibaldo.com/how-to-preview-ghosts-drafts-in-gatsbyjs-part-1)
1. [Implement the preview page](https://fedetibaldo.com/how-to-preview-ghosts-drafts-in-gatsbyjs-part-2)
1. [Get ready for production](https://fedetibaldo.com/how-to-preview-ghosts-drafts-in-gatsbyjs-part-3)

Each part is mapped to a branch, namely `part-1`, `part-2`, and `part-3`.

Navigate between them to move through the history of the project.
